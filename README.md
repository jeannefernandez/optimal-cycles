# optimal-cycles
Finding optimal representatives of general periodicity in climatic times series.


This repository uses the package minimal-generator, publicly available here: https://github.com/TDAMinimalGeneratorResearch/minimal-generator, 
as well as the Giotto-tda library, available here: https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/latest/library.html.

As climatic data we use the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillator, known as ENSO, which is available here: https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/. 
For syntethic data, we use the Charney Devore model.
